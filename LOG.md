### Actions Taken

1. **Reviewed Provenance Storage Implementation**
   - Verified existing `backend/core/kernel/lineage/storage.py` with ProvenanceStorage class
   - Confirmed import path uses `backend.app.core.supabase` (not `backend.core.services.supabase_client`)

2. **Added Missing `create_snapshot` Method**
   - File: `backend/core/kernel/lineage/storage.py`
   - Added `hashlib` and `json` imports
   - Implemented `create_snapshot()` method for audit/replay functionality

3. **Created Database Migration**
   - File: `deploy/supabase/migrations/20260510_provenance_storage.sql`
   - Added columns to execution_lineage: trace_id, correlation_id, causation_id
   - Created `provenance_nodes` table with unique constraint on (execution_id, node_type, node_name)
   - Created `provenance_edges` table
   - Created `provenance_snapshots` table with integrity_hash
   - Added indexes for graph traversal performance
   - Configured RLS policies for service_role

### Notes

- Log.md already present in .gitignore (line 29)
- ProvenanceStorage uses singleton pattern via `_instance` class variable
- Graph updates happen in real-time during event storage
- Snapshots use SHA256 hash of canonical JSON for integrity verification
